Step 1: Download The Source Code

2. Open the terminal and use the wget command to download the Linux kernel source code:

command// wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.0.7.tar.xz

Step 2: Extract the Source Code

commad// tar xvf linux-6.0.7.tar.xz

Step 3: Install Required Packages

command//  sudo apt-get install git fakeroot build-essential ncurses-dev xz-utils libssl-dev bc flex libelf-dev bison

The command we used above installs the following packages:

Package	        Package description
git	               Tracks and makes a record of all changes during development in the source code. It also allows reverting the changes.
fakeroot	        Creates the fake root environment.
build-essential	Installs development tools such as C, C++, gcc, and g++.
ncurses-dev	        Provides API for the text-based terminals.
xz-utils	        Provides fast file compression and decompression.
libssl-dev	        Supports SSL and TSL that encrypt data and make the internet connection secure.
bc (Basic Calculator)	 Supports the interactive execution of statements.
flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)	Generates lexical analyzers that convert characters into tokens.
libelf-dev	       Issues a shared library for managing ELF files (executable files, core dumps and object code)
bison	                Converts grammar description to a C program.

Step 4: Configure Kernel

The Linux kernel source code comes with the default configuration. However, you can adjust it to your needs. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the linux-6.0.7 directory using the cd command:
cd linux-6.0.7

2. Copy the existing configuration file using the cp command:
cp -v /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config


3. To make changes to the configuration file, run the make command:

make menuconfig  
The command launches several scripts that open the configuration menu:


4. The configuration menu includes options such as firmware, file system, network, and memory settings. Use the arrows to make a selection or choose Help to learn more about the options. When you finish making the changes, select Save, and then exit the menu.
